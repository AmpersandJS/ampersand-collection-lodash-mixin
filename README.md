# ampersand-collection-lodash-mixin

Lead Maintainer: [Clemens Stolle](https://github.com/klaemo)

A mixin for extending ampersand-collection with a bunch of lodash methods.

~~If you're using an [ampersand-rest-collection](http://ampersandjs.com/docs/#ampersand-rest-collection) this is already mixed in for you.~~
(Not yet, but maybe soon? :D)

Out of the box, ampersand-collections proxy the [ES5 iteration methods already](http://ampersandjs.com/docs/#ampersand-collection-proxied-es5-array-methods-9) so you don't _have_ to use this mixin, but if you want lodash methods, or better browser support, you can use this.

This mixin adds the following lodash methods:

```
countBy, difference, drop, each, every, filter, find, findWhere, first,
forEach, groupBy, includes, indexBy, indexOf, initial, invoke, isEmpty, last, 
lastIndexOf, map, max, min, partition, reduce, reduceRight, reject, rest, 
sample, shuffle, size, some, sortBy, take, where, without
```

## install

```
npm install ampersand-collection-lodash-mixin
```

## example

```javascript
var Collection = require('ampersand-collection');
var lodashMixin = require('ampersand-collection-lodash-mixin');


module.exports = Collection.extend(lodashMixin, {
    sampleMethod: function () {
        // now we've got lodash methods 
        // we can call that are applied to models
        // in the collection.
        this.filter( ... );
        this.some( ... );
        this.each( ... )
    }
});
```
